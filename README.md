This was a CS 460 (Machine Learning) project.

The task is to create a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network which "looks" at 28x28 drawings of the numbers 0 and 1. The network trains itself on a number of inputs, and when the training is done, passes the testing data through. With 5 epochs and a learning rate of 0.2, I've achieved just above %99.95 accuracy.

This is not the most efficient solution for the task, but it does work. There are a number of improvements I could potentially make.
